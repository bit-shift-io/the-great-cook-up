# Dutch Almond Fingers

Serves 8
Prep 30 min 
Cook 30 min

## Ingredients for Pastry

* 200g (1 2/3 cups) plain flour
* 5g (1 tsp) baking powder
* pinch of salt
* 100g (1/2 cup) brown sugar
* 150g butter

## Ingredients for Filling

* 75g almond meal
* 75g caster sugar
* zest from 1/2 lemon
* 1/2 tsp almond extract (optional)
* water
* 1 egg
* shaved almonds

## Method

1. Mix ingredients for filling: almond meal, caster sugar, lemon zest, almond extract, shaved almonds.
2. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time to form a thick damp paste.
3. Beat egg and add a little at a time to reduce consistency (should only need about half the egg).
4. Mix ingredients for pastry: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, butter. Nuke for 20 seconds if needed to soften the butter. To form a dough.
5. Divide pastry dough, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hr (I skip this step, I think its to make it less sticky and easier to roll?).
6. Preheat oven to 180. I used 220 degrees in my crap oven with a heat diffuser at the bottom.
7. Roll our pastry dough, cut and place in bottom of muffin tray. Add a tea spoon of filling. Cover with more pastry dough.
8. Brush with egg. Add shaved almonds on top. Brush again with egg.
9. Bake for ~20 mins or till tops start craking and going golden brown.
10. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 min then empty onto a cooling rack.

## Notes

These taste best on the day after being cooked.
