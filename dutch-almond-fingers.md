# Dutch Almond Fingers

Serves 8
Prep 30 min 
Cook 30 min

## Ingredients for Pastry

* 230g (1 2/3 cups) plain flour
* 5g (1 tsp) baking powder
* pinch of salt
* 100g (1/2 cup) brown sugar
* 150g butter
* 1/2 tsp almond extract (optional)
* 1/2 tsp vanilla essence (optional)

## Ingredients for Filling

* 95g almond meal
* 95g caster sugar
* zest from 1/2 lemon
* 1/2 tsp almond extract (optional)
* water
* 1 egg
* shaved almonds
* 1 dried apricot finely diced (optional)

## Method

1. Mix ingredients for filling: almond meal, caster sugar, lemon zest, almond extract, shaved almonds, diced apricot.
2. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time to form a thick damp paste.
3. Beat egg and add a little at a time to reduce consistency (should only need about half the egg).
4. Mix ingredients for pastry: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, butter, almond extract, vanilla essence. Nuke for 20 seconds if needed to soften the butter. Form a dough.
5. Divide pastry dough, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hr (I skip this step, I think its to make it less sticky and easier to roll?).
6. Preheat oven to 180. I used 220 degrees in my crap oven with a heat diffuser at the bottom.
7. Roll out pastry dough into a rectangle. Spread almond filling over the top. Try to fold the dough over the top if you can get it thin enough.
8. Brush with egg. Add shaved almonds on top. Brush again with egg.
9. Bake for ~20 mins or till tops start craking and going golden brown.
10. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 min then empty onto a cooling rack.

## Notes

These taste best on the day after being cooked.
