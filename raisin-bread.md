# Raisin Bread

## Ingredients - Experiment 3

* 2 1/2 cup of flour (I used 1 cup wholemeal + 1 1/2 cup white)
* 1 tsp sugar OR cinammon suguar (OR try 1/2 tsp cinammon + 1/2 tsp sugar)
* sprinkle of salt
* 300 ml water
* 1 tsp yeast
* 1/2 cup raisins (maybe try 1/2 to reduce density of loaf?) - PUT IN THE DEISPENSER AND USE MENU 3 (Basic Raisin)
* 1/2 tsp all spice + 1/2 tsp nutmeg - OR try 1 tsp mixed spice

## Notes - Experiment 3

Less dense than experiment #2. But not enough raisins. So next time try 1 cup raisins, and 2.5 cups flour.
Try powdering raisins in flour before hand.

## Ingredients - Experiment 2

* 2 1/4 cup of flour (I used 1 cup wholemeal + 1 1/4 cup white)
* 1 tsp sugar OR cinammon suguar (OR try 1/2 tsp cinammon + 1/2 tsp sugar)
* sprinkle of salt
* 300 ml water
* 1 tsp yeast
* 1 cup raisins (maybe try 1/2 to reduce density of loaf?) - PUT IN THE DEISPENSER AND USE MENU 3 (Basic Raisin)
* 1/2 tsp all spice + 1/2 tsp nutmeg - OR try 1 tsp mixed spice

## Notes - Experiment 2

Taste good, comes out pretty dense compared to a normal load though.
Taste better fresh but still works great toasted!
