# Raisin Bread

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cup of flour (I use 1 cup wholemeal + 1 1/2 cup white)
* 300 ml water
* 1 tsp yeast
* 1 cup some combination of: raisins, prunes, or dates (dates are the best!) - PUT IN THE DISPENSER AND USE MENU 3 (Basic Raisin)

* 1 tsp some combination of: sugar, cinammon
* 1 tsp some combination of: all spice, nutmeg, mixed spice

* sprinkle of salt (optional)
* 1/2 tsp vanilla essence (optional - maybe helps make it smoother?)

* 1/2 tsp baking powder (optional - extra raising agent, maybe helps make it smoother?)
* 1/2 tsp bicarb (optional - extra raising agent, maybe helps make it smoother?)
