# Raisin Bread


## Ingredients

* 2 tsp yeast
* 2 1/2 cup of bread flour
* 300 ml water

* 1/2 tsp cinamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp allspice
* 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
* 1/2 tsp butter (opt)
* 1/2 tsp oil (opt)
* 1 tsp maple syrup (not the fake stuff)

* 1 cup some combination of: raisins, prunes, or dates 

## Instructions

1. Yest on the bottom, then flour, then everything else. Keep the spices SEPERATE from the YEAST.
2. Fruit in the dispenser.
3. Machine: MENU 3 (Basic Raisin), Light crust, L or XL size.
4. Cook right away for max flavour. If the load comes out with a flat/collapsed and heavy, reduce yeast.

## Notes

If you leave it overnight, the yeast seems to pig out on the spice and make the bread heavy.
