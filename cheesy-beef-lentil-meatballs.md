2. Heat the oil in a large wok over a medium-high heat. Cook the meat etc that was placed together in a large bowl until mince meat is brown.
3. Add woolworths essentials chunky pasta sauce to the wok.
4. Combine tomato and vinegar in a bowl. Season. Add the tomato mixture to the wok. Add the mozarella and feta to the wok. Simmer for a few minutes.

## Notes

Original recipe is too slow and time consuming so I turned it into a chunky meat sauce.
Can have each serve with half a tub of brown rice.
