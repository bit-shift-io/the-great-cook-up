# Mushroom Sauce

For use on pasta or chicken shnitz potatoes etc

## Ingredients

* 1-2Tb olive oil
* 2Tb butter
* 3Tb flour or 1-3tsp cornflour
* 300g mushrooms
* 1-2Tb minced garlic
* salt & pepper


## Extras

* cooking wine
* chicken/beef stock
* thyme
* cream

## Method

1. Heat oil and melt butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add mushrooms and leisurely cook until golden brown - takes about 4 to 5 minutes. No need to stir constantly
2. Just before they're done, add the garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until garlic is golden ~1m
3. Add white wine, stir, scraping the bottom of the skillet, for 1 minute or until mostly evaporated
4. Add broth, milk/cream and parmesan. Stir, then lower heat to medium so the sauce is simmering - do not boil rapidly, cream may split. Stir occasionally and simmer for 2 - 3 minutes until it thickens. It shouldn't be super thick
5. Stir through thyme, adjust salt and pepper to taste. Remove from stove


## Notes

If you want to use cream, then just eliminate the flour and replace the milk with heavy cream.
