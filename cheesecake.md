* 1 Tbs brown sugar
* pinch of salt

## Filling Ingredients

* 2 1/4 tsp gelatin (try without this next time!)

* 500g cream cheese block
* 2/3 cup caster sugar (1 cup for super sweet)
* 1 tsp vanilla essence
* 1 Tbs lemon juice

## Method

1. Blitz crumb ingredients. Press into a pan.
2. Whip cream in a bowl.
3. Whip cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and lemon, salt, gelatine in a seperate bowl.
4. Fold in cream.
5. Spread over crust, then fridge for ~6 hrs.

Decorate with passionfruit pulp or strawberries.
Gelatine stuffed up and made it gross, so try without!
Try do a thin crust and thin layer of cake over the top - maybe a pizza tray with baking paper?
