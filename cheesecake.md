## Method

1. Crush biscuits in a plastic freezer bag with a malett. Combine with brown sugar and soft butter. Press firmly to a large plate covered with baking paper. Ideally refrigerate for 1hr if time permits.
2. Beat till smooth: cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla essence, raw sugar, greek yoghurt.
3. In a seprate bowl whip thickend cream.
4. Mix 1/2 (try 2/3rds next time?) the thickend cream into the cream cheese mix by hand.
5. Pour filling over crust. Refrigerate for 24hrs.
6. Top with left over cream cheese (be aware: this will reduce tanginess), passion fruit mixed with a little caster sugar or other berries.

## Notes

In future I want to try throwing in some saltanas. Also try xanthm gum as a thickener?
