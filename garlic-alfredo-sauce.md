# Garlic Alfredo Sauce

2.5 cups of sauce

For use on pasta or chicken shnitz

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup (113 g) butter (1/2 stick)
* 4 cloves (4 cloves) garlic , minced (or 2 teaspoons garlic powder)
* 1/4 cup (30 g) all-purpose flour
* 2 cups (480 ml) milk
* 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 ml) dried herbs (basil, oregano, thyme, etc.)
* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) dried mustard powder
* 1 cup (100 g) grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt , or to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) fresh cracked black pepper

## Method

1. Heat a sauce pan on medium-high heat. Melt butter, then add garlic and cook translucent and fragrant (about 1 minute). Whisk in flour and continue whisking to remove large clumps.
2. Slowly whisk in the milk. Whisking often to make sure flour lumps are smooth, bring sauce to a low boil. Then reduce heat to low.
3. Add dried herbs, mustard powder, parmesan, salt and pepper. Continue whisking until sauce is smooth and begins to thicken.
4. If youâ€™re saving the sauce for later, allow the sauce to completely cool.
5. Keep in fridge and use within 5 days.

## Notes

If you want to use heavy cream, then just eliminate the flour and replace the milk with heavy cream.
