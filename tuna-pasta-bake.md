3. Combine pasta, veg, tomato mix, tuna (keep 50% of juice for extra juice n flavour), spinach in baking dish. Cover in ricotta and parmy (optional). Sprinkle with basil. Bake for ~20min

## Notes

I used Tuna, but Red salmon is given in the origional recipie which might have a stronger flavour.

Serve with a sprinkle of parmy instead of adding it at bake time.
