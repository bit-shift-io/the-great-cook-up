# Baked Schnitzel with Tartar

Serves: 4

Time: 20 min prep + 30 min cook

## Ingredients

* 4 veal steaks or chicken breast fillets
* 2 Tbl plain flour
* 1 egg
* 1 cup panko bread crumbs
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan (or any grated cheese)
* 1 tsb lemon rind

## Ingredients for Tartar

* 1/2 cup mayo
* 2 tsp seeded mustard
* 1 gherkin, finely chopped
* 2 tsp lemon juice

## Method

1. Prepare tartar.
2. Toss meat in flour, dip in beaten egg, coat firmly with combination of breadcrumbs, lemon rind, parmesan.
3. Bake in oven (~200 degrees) for 10 mins.
3. Flip the meat, apply extra cheese if desired, and bake for another 10 mins.

## Notes

Instead of mixing cheese into the breadcrumb mix, we applied it as a seperate topping while in the oven.
Do it on both sides, i.e. apply more when you flip the meat over.
